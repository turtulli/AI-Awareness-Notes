# AI Awareness Notes (AIAN)

## AI Story
Yuval Noah Harari argues that humans became humans as they gathered around stories. Telling stories gave rise to a collective identity, a sense of purpose, and a foundation for cooperation. 

Now we have a new story, Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Science is not as compelling as stories...

The brain is much more complex than a network of neurons, even though neurons themselves are relatively simple. AI Neural Networks are inspired by the structure of the human brain's network of neurons, but they are vastly simplified.

In fact, Geoffrey Hinton, the godfather of AI, successfully advocated for a focus on solving specific tasks that work **mathematically**, rather than strictly mimicking the intricacies of biological neural networks when developing artificial neural networks (ANNs).

Fei-Fei Li says that when building an airplane, it's aerodynamics and physics that govern the process of flying. If we ask for similar laws in the relationship between AI and brain, it still feels like we are before Newton's laws. 

### So, what makes AI still so powerful like ChatGPT? (to do)
