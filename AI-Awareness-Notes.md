# AI Awareness Notes

## AI Story
Yuval Noah Harari argues that humans became humans as they gathered around stories. Telling stories gave rise to a collective identity, a sense of purpose, and a foundation for cooperation. 

Now we have a new story, Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Science is not as compelling as stories...

The brain is much more complex than a network of neurons, even though neurons themselves are relatively simple. AI Neural Networks are inspired by the structure of the human brain's network of neurons, but they are vastly simplified.

In fact, Geoffrey Hinton, the godfather of AI, successfully advocated for a focus on solving specific tasks that work **mathematically**, rather than strictly mimicking the intricacies of biological neural networks when developing artificial neural networks (ANNs).

Fei-Fei Li says that when building an airplane, it is aerodynamics and physics that govern the process of flying. If we ask for similar laws in the relationship between AI and brain, it still feels like we are before Newton's laws. 

## AI Advantages
Our brain consumes 30 watts when learning, while an AI like ChatGPT consumes 30 megawatts when training (learning). You can find other numbers online, but let's just focus on these numbers. The order of magnitude of the power used is enormous, 1 to 1 million. But while this ratio is interesting, I don't think we are really impressed by that. I think, we humans have surpassed that point since the invention of the steam engine, which propelled the industrial revolution and the power of the machines took over hand labor.

So, we can naturally imagine that there are some very powerful computers, and a lot of them, working intensively to process any data they can find in the world. This is actually the core advantage of AI over the human brain: the scale at which AI can operate.

We also know that while biological intelligence is mortal, digital intelligence is immortal. We can copy ChatGPT to some other computers.

What is surprising, though, is that digital intelligence may have a better learning algorithm than the brain.
